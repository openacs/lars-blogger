<h3>Why</h3>

<p>
  I wrote this blogger package for my own web site at <a
  href="http://www.pinds.com/">pinds.com</a>. For background
  information, please visit <a
  href="http://www.pinds.com/download/">http://www.pinds.com/download</a>.
</p>

<h3>Download</h3>

<p>
  The blogger now lives in the <a
  href="http://openacs.org">OpenACS</a> cvs repository.
</p>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>
  Install the package on your system, mount a new instance somewhere
  on the site map, make sure you have admin permission on the
  instance, and then visit /admin under the URL where you mounted
  it. Now you can add your first blog entry.
</p>

<h3>Syndicating a blog (putting it on your front page)</h3>

<p>
  If you want to include a blog as part of another page, that's pretty
  simple.
</p>

<p>
  If you're including in an ADP, say:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;include src="/packages/lars-blogger/www/blog" url="/blog"&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
  ... for the non-cached version, and ...
</p>

<blockquote><pre>&lt;%=[lars_blog_get_as_string -url "/blog"]%&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>
  ... for the cached version. There shouldn't be any problems using
  the cached version, as the cache should be flushed whenever anything
  changes.
</p>

<p>
  From a Tcl page:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
set blog_html [template::adp_parse "[acs_package_root_dir "lars-blogger"]/www/blog" [list url "/blog"]]
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
  ... for the non-cached version, and ...
</p>

<blockquote><pre>[lars_blog_get_as_string -url "/blog"]</pre></blockquote>

<p>
  ... for the cached version.
</p>

<p>
  All of these are shown with an argument 'url' here, but they all
  take a package_id argument instead, if you prefer that and know what
  the package_id is. If nothing's supplied, the current package is
  used, which is generally not what you want.
</p>


<h3>Technical Info</h3>

<p>
  The package fully supports multiple instances, i.e., you can mount
  several instances in your site map, and they'll stay properly isolated
  from each other.
</p>

<p>
  Contents in your blog entries are assumed to be full-blooded
  ADP-ified HTML, so don't give people access to post a blog unless
  you trust them. I guess it should be made configurable whether to
  allow this or not, but since I'm developing this for my own site
  primarily, I haven't done so. This also means that if you've added
  custom ADP tags, those are also available to you in your blog.
</p>

<h3>weblogs.com update ping</h3>

<p>
  There are a couple parameters governing this feature. You can turn it
  on or off on a per-package basis. And you can specify which URL you
  want to export to weblogs.com, in case it's not the one the package
  instance is mounted at. This can be useful if you're including the
  blog on other pages, for example your site's front page. Thanks to
  Jerry Asher for the code to do this.
</p>

<h3>RSS Feed</h3>

<p>
  The RSS feed is version 1.0 only, and uses the rss-support
  package. You should be able to simply visit the admin page of your
  new blogger instance and click the "Setup RSS" link, and you'll have
  an RSS feed.
</p>

<p>
  Then you'll need to set the parameters and say that your
  rss_file_url is at
  /where-your-blogger-instnace-sists/rss/rss.xml. If you leave this
  blank, we won't advertise your RSS feed URL anywhere.
</p>

<p>
  You can also supply your own channel image through the
  parameters.
</p>

<h3>Road Map</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Categorize and full-text-search-index blog entries so the archives
    are more useful.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use content repository.
  </li>
  <li>
    Community-maintained blog ... everybody with 'write' can post entries.
  </li>
  <li>
    Moderation-feature: Entries posted by non-admins must go through a
    workflow-administered approval process.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ability to modify templates for each instance individually through
    the UI (<a href="http://openacs.org/forums/message-view?message_id=87313">see this thread</a>)
  </li>
  <li>
    Nicer interface (MovableType)
  </li>
  <li>
    More thorough documentation and some setup/config pages.
  </li>
</ul>

    <b>0.8.4</b> Oops, getting behind on the version history. In the last
    few releases, I've rearranged a bunch of templates to make it
    more consistent and easier to customize; I've fixed the code that
    sets up the RSS stuff, so you can now simply go to the admin page
    and say "setup RSS"; I've integrated the new richtext widget which
    I added to the templating system. (February 6, 2003)

    <b>0.7d</b> Finished port to Oracle. Upgraded PG drop
