<h1>Weblogger Documentation</h1>

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>
  The blogger now lives in the <a
  href="http://openacs.org">OpenACS</a> cvs repository.
</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>
  Install the package on your system, mount a new instance somewhere
  on the site map, make sure you have create permission on the
  instance, and then visit the URL where you mounted
  it. Now you can add your first blog entry.
</p>

<h2>Syndicating a blog (putting it on your front page)</h2>

<p>
  If you want to include a blog as part of another page, that's pretty
  simple.
</p>

<p>
  If you're including in an ADP, say:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;include src="/packages/lars-blogger/www/blog" url="/blog"&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
  ... for the non-cached version, and ...
</p>

<blockquote><pre>&lt;%=[lars_blog_get_as_string -url "/blog"]%&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>
  ... for the cached version. There shouldn't be any problems using
  the cached version, as the cache should be flushed whenever anything
  changes.
</p>

<p>
  From a Tcl page:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
set blog_html [template::adp_parse "[acs_package_root_dir "lars-blogger"]/www/blog" [list url "/blog"]]
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
  ... for the non-cached version, and ...
</p>

<blockquote><pre>[lars_blog_get_as_string -url "/blog"]</pre></blockquote>

<p>
  ... for the cached version.
</p>

<p>
  All of these are shown with an argument 'url' here, but they all
  take a package_id argument instead, if you prefer that and know what
  the package_id is. If nothing's supplied, the current package is
  used, which is generally not what you want.
</p>


<h2>Technical Info</h2>

<p>
  The package fully supports multiple instances. You can mount
  several instances in your site map, and they'll stay properly isolated
  from each other. Alternatively you can let multiple users post to one 
  instance by granting create permissions. Mounting Weblogger under, say, 
  /blog, you will have /blog/user/screenname displaying the entries of one
  user and /blog displaying either a list of all bloggers (this is done by
  setting the parameter DisplayUsersP to 1) or all entries posted to the
  instance (the default).
</p>

<p>
  Contents in your blog entries are assumed to be full-blooded
  ADP-ified HTML, so don't give people access to post a blog (i.e. grant
  create permissions on the instance) unless you trust them. This also means 
  that if you've added custom ADP tags, those are also available to you in your blog.
</p>

<h2>Permissions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>'read' means people can read entries.</li>
  <li>'create' means people can create entries and edit/publish/draft/delete their own entries.</li>
  <li>'write' means people can edit/draft/publish/delete all entries in the package instance.</li>
  <li>'admin' means people can define categories, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>weblogs.com update ping</h2>

<p>
  There are a couple parameters governing this feature. You can turn it
  on or off on a per-package basis. And you can specify which URL you
  want to export to weblogs.com, in case it's not the one the package
  instance is mounted at. This can be useful if you're including the
  blog on other pages, for example your site's front page. Thanks to
  Jerry Asher for the code to do this.
</p>

<h2>RSS Feed</h2>

<p>
  The RSS feed is version 1.0 only, and uses the rss-support
  package. You should be able to simply visit the admin page of your
  new blogger instance and click the "Setup RSS" link, and you'll have
  an RSS feed.
</p>

<p>
  Then you'll need to set the parameters and say that your
  rss_file_name is at
  /where-your-blogger-instnace-sists/rss/rss.xml. If you leave this
  blank, we won't advertise your RSS feed URL anywhere.
</p>

<p>
  You can also supply your own channel image through the
  parameters.
</p>

<h2>XML-RPC APIs</h2>

<p>
  The Blogger and MetaWeblog APIs are supported. An <a
  href="http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/rsd">RSD</a> link is placed on
  your Blog's front page, allowing XML-RPC client tools to automatically
  discover which API's they can use. See the <a href="/doc/xml-rpc">XML-RPC
  package documentation</a> for more details. Disable the XML-RPC server to
  disallow access to your blog via XML-RPC.
</p>

<h2>Posting From News Aggregator via URL</h2>

<p>
  Some news aggregators can blog items you read via simply sending you
  to the proper URL. Here's what you need to specify in <a
  href="http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/index.asp">FeedDemon</a> to
  make Blog-this-item work there:
</p>

<pre>
<i>URL-of-your-blog</i>/entry-edit?title=$ITEM_TITLE$&title_url=$ITEM_LINK$&content=$ITEM_DESCRIPTION$
</pre>

<h2>Road Map</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Full-text-search-index blog entries so the archives
    are more useful.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use new categories package for categorization
  </li>
  <li>
    Use content repository.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ability to modify templates for each instance and user individually through
    the UI.
  </li>
  <li>WYISIYG editor</li>
  <li>Improved RSS 2.0 feed stuff</li>
  <li>Improved Configuration Settings.</li>
  <li>Technorati</li>
  <li>Blogroll.</li>
  <li>Integrate with bookshelf, photo-album in a portal</li>
  <li>Make it safe to use in a not-so-protected environment, e.g.,
    disable &lt;% ... %&gt; ADP notation.</li>
  <li>Better documentation.</li>
  <li>
    Moderation-feature: Entries posted by non-admins must go through a
    workflow-administered approval process.
  </li>
  <li>
    Nicer interface (MovableType/TypePad has a nice interface)
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Version History</h2>

    on the front page (July 10, 2003)

  </li>
  <li>
    <b>0.8.6</b> Cleaned up RSS-support even more and made it work
    under Oracle. Also made a slight style change, using the

    arrow-box.gif I used to use. (May 9, 2003)

    few releases, I've rearranged a bunch of templates to make it
    more consistent and easier to customize; I've fixed the code that
    sets up the RSS stuff, so you can now simply go to the admin page
    and say "setup RSS"; I've integrated the new richtext widget which
    I added to the templating system. (February 6, 2003)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>0.7d</b> Finished port to Oracle. Upgraded PG drop
