<h1>Weblogger Documentation</h1>

 and Simon Carstensen
<h2>Download</h2>
<p>The blogger now lives in the <a href="http://openacs.org">OpenACS</a> cvs repository.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Install the package on your system, mount a new instance
somewhere on the site map, make sure you have create permission on
the instance, and then visit the URL where you mounted it. Now you
can add your first blog entry.</p>
<h2>Syndicating a blog (putting it on your front page)</h2>
<p>If you want to include a blog as part of another page,
that&#39;s pretty simple.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re including in an ADP, say:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
&lt;include src="/packages/lars-blogger/www/blog" url="/blog"&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>... for the non-cached version, and ...</p>
<blockquote><pre>
&lt;%=[lars_blog_get_as_string -url "/blog"]%&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>... for the cached version. There shouldn&#39;t be any problems
using the cached version, as the cache should be flushed whenever
anything changes.</p>
<p>From a Tcl page:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
set blog_html [template::adp_parse "[acs_package_root_dir "lars-blogger"]/www/blog" [list url "/blog"]]
</pre></blockquote>
<p>... for the non-cached version, and ...</p>
<blockquote><pre>
[lars_blog_get_as_string -url "/blog"]
</pre></blockquote>
<p>... for the cached version.</p>
<p>All of these are shown with an argument 'url' here, but
they all take a package_id argument instead, if you prefer that and
know what the package_id is. If nothing&#39;s supplied, the current
package is used, which is generally not what you want.</p>
<h2>Technical Info</h2>
<p>The package fully supports multiple instances. You can mount
several instances in your site map, and they&#39;ll stay properly
isolated from each other. Alternatively you can let multiple users
post to one instance by granting create permissions. Mounting
Weblogger under, say, /blog, you will have /blog/user/screenname
displaying the entries of one user and /blog displaying either a
list of all bloggers (this is done by setting the parameter
DisplayUsersP to 1) or all entries posted to the instance (the
default).</p>
<p>Contents in your blog entries are assumed to be full-blooded
ADP-ified HTML, so don&#39;t give people access to post a blog
(i.e. grant create permissions on the instance) unless you trust
them. This also means that if you&#39;ve added custom ADP tags,
those are also available to you in your blog.</p>
<h2>Permissions</h2>
<ul>
<li>'read' means people can read entries.</li><li>'create' means people can create entries and
edit/publish/draft/delete their own entries.</li><li>'write' means people can edit/draft/publish/delete all
entries in the package instance.</li><li>'admin' means people can define categories, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>weblogs.com update ping</h2>
<p>There are a couple parameters governing this feature. You can
turn it on or off on a per-package basis. And you can specify which
URL you want to export to weblogs.com, in case it&#39;s not the one
the package instance is mounted at. This can be useful if
you&#39;re including the blog on other pages, for example your
site&#39;s front page. Thanks to Jerry Asher for the code to do
this.</p>
<h2>RSS Feed</h2>
<p>The RSS feed is version 1.0 only, and uses the rss-support
package. You should be able to simply visit the admin page of your
new blogger instance and click the "Setup RSS" link, and
you&#39;ll have an RSS feed.</p>
<p>Then you&#39;ll need to set the parameters and say that your
rss_file_name is at /where-your-blogger-instnace-sists/rss/rss.xml.
If you leave this blank, we won&#39;t advertise your RSS feed URL
anywhere.</p>
<p>You can also supply your own channel image through the
parameters.</p>
<h2>XML-RPC APIs</h2>
<p>The Blogger and MetaWeblog APIs are supported. An <a href="http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/rsd">RSD</a> link is placed on
your Blog&#39;s front page, allowing XML-RPC client tools to
automatically discover which API&#39;s they can use. See the
<a href="/doc/xml-rpc">XML-RPC package documentation</a> for more
details. Disable the XML-RPC server to disallow access to your blog
via XML-RPC.</p>
<h2>Posting From News Aggregator via URL</h2>
<p>Some news aggregators can blog items you read via simply sending
you to the proper URL. Here&#39;s what you need to specify in
<a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/index.asp">FeedDemon</a>
to make Blog-this-item work there:</p>
<pre>
<em>URL-of-your-blog</em>/entry-edit?title=$ITEM_TITLE$&amp;title_url=$ITEM_LINK$&amp;content=$ITEM_DESCRIPTION$
</pre>
<h2>Road Map</h2>
<ul>
<li>Full-text-search-index blog entries so the archives are more
useful.</li><li>Use new categories package for categorization</li><li>Use content repository.</li><li>Ability to modify templates for each instance and user
individually through the UI.</li><li>WYISIYG editor</li><li>Improved RSS 2.0 feed stuff</li><li>Improved Configuration Settings.</li><li>Technorati</li><li>Blogroll.</li><li>Integrate with bookshelf, photo-album in a portal</li><li>Make it safe to use in a not-so-protected environment, e.g.,
disable &lt;% ... %&gt; ADP notation.</li><li>Better documentation.</li><li>Moderation-feature: Entries posted by non-admins must go
through a workflow-administered approval process.</li><li>Nicer interface (MovableType/TypePad has a nice interface)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version History</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>1.0</strong> Added support for categories, cleaned up
permissions handling, styled with stylesheets, trackback
support.</li><li>
<strong>0.9.2</strong> Added parameters to control the number
of entries shown on the front page (July 10, 2003)</li><li>
<strong>0.9</strong> Added support for multiple users. (June
10, 2003)</li><li>
<strong>0.8.7</strong> Fixed notifications to include the
title_url, and to not have extra spaces in the month name. (May 11,
2003)</li><li>
<strong>0.8.6</strong> Cleaned up RSS-support even more and
made it work under Oracle. Also made a slight style change, using
the &amp;raquo; (Â») style for action links, which I&#39;ve
adopted for other packages. It&#39;s less intrusive than the
harshly-colored arrow-box.gif I used to use. (May 9, 2003)</li><li>
<strong>0.8.5</strong> Added title URL, cleanup (March 28,
2003)</li><li>
<strong>0.8.4</strong> Oops, getting behind on the version
history. In the last few releases, I&#39;ve rearranged a bunch of
templates to make it more consistent and easier to customize;
I&#39;ve fixed the code that sets up the RSS stuff, so you can now
simply go to the admin page and say "setup RSS"; I&#39;ve
integrated the new richtext widget which I added to the templating
system. (February 6, 2003)</li><li>
<strong>0.7d</strong> Finished port to Oracle. Upgraded PG drop
script. Renamed RSS proc which requires running the SQL upgrade
script (for PG). Bug-fix to bypass 'draft' and publish
directly. -vinodk (August 15, 2002)</li><li>
<strong>0.6.4d</strong> Added poster information, optional per
parameter. Added "url" shortcut variable to the blog
template. Updated documentation. (July 23, 2002)</li><li>
<strong>0.6.3d</strong> Added drop scripts, and made the create
script call rss-register. Fixed minor bugs. (July 22, 2002)</li><li>
<strong>0.6.1d</strong> Fixed RSS last update bug. (Jun 2,
2002)</li><li>

arrow-box.gif patch. (May 13, 2002)</li><li>
<strong>0.3.2d</strong> Missing files from the
distribution.</li><li>
<strong>0.3d</strong> Improved admin interface, added
documentation. (March 24, 2002)</li><li>
<strong>0.2d</strong> Allow and show comments on blog. (March
23, 2002)</li><li>
